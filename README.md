# NumericalMethods_PDEs
This repository contains implementations and reports developed during the course Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations. It explores finite element techniques to solve elliptic and parabolic PDEs, with a focus on error estimation, adaptive mesh refinement, and physical applications such as porous media flow.
